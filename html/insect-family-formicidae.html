            <h3>Description</h3>  
            <p>
                The family Formicidae belongs to the order Hymenoptera, which also includes sawflies, bees, and wasps.
                Ants evolved from a lineage within the stinging wasps, and a 2013 study suggests that they are a sister group 
                of the Apoidea. In 1966, E. O. Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant (Sphecomyrma) 
                that lived in the Cretaceous period. The specimen, trapped in amber dating back to around 92 million years ago, has 
                features found in some wasps, but not found in modern ants. The oldest fossils of ants date to the mid-Cretaceous,
                around 100 million years ago, which belong to extinct stem-groups such as the Haidomyrmecinae, Sphecomyrminae and 
                Zigrasimeciinae, with modern ant subfamilies appearing towards the end of the Cretaceous around 80–70 million years 
                ago. Ants diversified extensively during the Angiosperm Terrestrial Revolution and assumed ecological 
                dominance around 60 million years ago. Some groups, such as the Leptanillinae and Martialinae, are 
                suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface
                of the soil.
