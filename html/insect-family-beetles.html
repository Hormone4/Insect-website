                The family Scarabaeidae, as currently defined, consists of over 35,000 species of beetles worldwide; 
                they are often called scarabs or scarab beetles. The classification of this family has undergone significant 
                change in recent years. Several groups formerly treated as subfamilies have been elevated to family rank 
                (e.g., Bolboceratidae, Geotrupidae, Glaresidae, Glaphyridae, Hybosoridae, Ochodaeidae, and Pleocomidae), 
                and some reduced to lower ranks. The subfamilies listed in this article are in accordance with those in Catalog of Life 
                (2023).
