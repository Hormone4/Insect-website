            <h3>Description</h3>  
            <p>
                Diptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance. 
                Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. 
                Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. 
                Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, 
                dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases; and houseflies, commensal 
                with humans all over the world, spread foodborne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of 
                the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. 
                Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known 
                as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for 
                carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.
